## Avoid double dipping!

A lightweight webapp for keeping track of who is bringing what to a party (to avoid having too many watermelons or something similar). Hosts can create an event and even include a list of things they'd like people to bring. Then, when they share the event's URL with guests (via text, email, Facebook, etc.) guests can sign up and indicate what they will bring.
